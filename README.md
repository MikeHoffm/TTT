# The Odin Project Tic Tac Toe

Live Link : https://mikehoffm.github.io/TTT/

- The Goal: To create a functioning game of Tic Tac Toe using JavaScript object constructors ( Factory Functions, Module Pattern ) that communicate through closure, while using minimal global scope.

- Concepts Practiced: Namespacing, Closure, Object Oriented Programming, Factory Functions, Module Pattern.

- Major Takeaways : Using modules, factory functions, and closure can be very useful. Having an idea of where things should reside within different constructors, and how they should communicate / pass along code was difficult but proved to be essential.

- Future Goals: Continue to use closure, & namespacing practices. Possibly revisit for CSS styling tweaks, & to add AI player 2.
